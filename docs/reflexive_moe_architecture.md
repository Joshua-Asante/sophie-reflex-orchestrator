# SOPHIE's Reflexive Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture

## 🎯 Executive Summary

SOPHIE is not just a mixture of experts—it's a **sovereign, role-aware conductor** of them. While Cursor's background agents and other static MoE systems route prompts to fixed models, SOPHIE infers user intent, classifies the context, and delegates tasks to the best-suited expert agents based on dynamic orchestration logic and trust overlays.

### Key Components

**1. Intent Parser**
- Analyzes user prompts for latent goals, plan state, risk tolerance
- Classifies intent into: EXECUTION, ANALYSIS, CREATION, PLANNING, COORDINATION, INFRASTRUCTURE
- Determines confidence scores and complexity estimates

**2. Context Classifier**
- Maps intent to cognitive roles: Corporate, Creative, Council
- Identifies domain requirements and resource needs
- Assesses risk levels and approval requirements

**3. Trust-Weighted Router**
- Selects optimal experts based on:
  - Domain strength alignment
  - Historical performance metrics
  - Current trust scores
  - Role-specific capabilities

**4. Reflexive Planner**
- Iteratively refines task outputs
- Monitors execution quality
- Adapts strategies based on feedback
- Falls back to constitutional executor when needed

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Expert Selection Algorithm

```python
def select_experts(intent: IntentClassification) -> List[ExpertAgent]:
    # Filter by suggested roles
    available_experts = filter_by_roles(intent.suggested_roles)
    
    # Score experts based on multiple factors
    expert_scores = []
    for expert in available_experts:
        base_score = expert.trust_score
        role_adjustment = (role_trust[expert.role] - 0.5) * 0.2
        performance_adjustment = (avg_performance - 0.5) * 0.3
        domain_match = calculate_domain_alignment(intent, expert)
        
        final_score = base_score + role_adjustment + performance_adjustment + domain_match
        expert_scores.append((expert, final_score))
    
    # Select based on complexity and intent
    if intent.estimated_complexity > 0.7:
        return top_n_experts(expert_scores, 3)  # Multiple experts
    elif intent.primary_intent == IntentType.COUNCIL:
        return filter_by_role(expert_scores, ExpertRole.COUNCIL, 2)
    else:
        return top_n_experts(expert_scores, 2)  # Standard selection
```

### Collaboration Strategy Selection

```python
def determine_collaboration_strategy(selected_experts: List[ExpertAgent]) -> str:
    if len(selected_experts) == 1:
        return "single_expert"
    elif len(selected_experts) == 2:
        return "parallel_execution"
    else:
        return "sequential_refinement"
